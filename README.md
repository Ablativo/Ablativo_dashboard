# Ablativo Dashboard

This repository contains the **React + Material UI** Dashboard used by the museum curators.

For the initial setup, we first need to make the 
```
aws-exports.js
```
containing the configuration for cognito ([look at the documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/start/q/platform/js#configure-your-application)).


Then run 
```
yarn install
```
for the packagesthe packages.


Finally, to run the app
```
yarn start
```
